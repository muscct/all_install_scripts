A key component of our strategy for power management involved the Dell iDrac. The iDrac is a small, low power consumtion chip used to manage the system remotely as well as limit power consumption. One iDrac is installed in each node, allowing us to set a hard limit on power consumption based on hardware power consumption measurements that feed into the iDrac. Aside from this, nvidia-smi provides monitoring and power limiting capabilities for our GPUs. This tool allows us to run each tesla V100 GPU at as low as 150V. Since the max TDP of our system greatly exceeds the 3KW power limit, and out testing has indicated that the V100 GPUs reach peak efficiency at around 180V, we will be relying on nvidia-smi to limit the power consumption of the GPUs so that we stay beneath the power limit while maintaining optimum efficiency. Lastly, since there is currently no GPU port of openMC, we plan to run openMC on the CPUs in times of low load in order to maximise utilisation of our hardware, which is equipped with 4 Xeon Phi processors.
