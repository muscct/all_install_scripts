# Order of operations
1. Use [copy_source_files.sh](utils/copy_source_files.sh) to copy relevant source archives to your node if you haven't done so already.
2. ssh into your machine
3. git clone https://github.com/muscct/all_install_scripts
4. change to the directory you want everything installed in.
5. run install.sh from that directory. It takes command line arguments that you can see by running install.sh -h. There are flags for installing each of our programs, and some other stuff too. 
6. watch my script break
